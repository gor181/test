title: Instructors, DataCamp

*** =script

I'm Michael Kane an Assistant Professor at Yale University and I'm Simon Urbanek an R-core member and Lead Inventive Scientist at AT&T Labs research. 
We're the instructors for the DataCamp class Scalable Data Processing in R. 

In this course, we'll teach you some of the techniques for cleaning, processing, and analyzing data that may be too large for your computer. We'll show you how to split data into manageable subsets, process them, and combine them in useful ways. 

We'll also show you how to write scalable code using bigmemory, which lets you create data sets that may be bigger than your computers RAM, and iotools, which let's you quickly import chunks of data, and process them sequentially.

As a case study, we'll provide a preliminary analysis of the Federal Housing Finance Agency's mortgage data.

See you in the course!
