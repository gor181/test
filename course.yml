title: Scalable Data Processing in R
description: "Datasets are often larger than available RAM, which causes problems
  for R programming since by default all the variables are stored in memory. This
  course introduces tools for processing, exploring, and analyzing data directly from
  disk. \n\nIn this talk, we'll make use of the Federal Housing Finance Agency's data,
  a publicly available data set chronicling all mortgages that were held or securitized
  by both Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan
  Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) from 2009-2015. This data set includes
  10's of millions of mortgage along with demographics and financial information about
  the individual lenders. By analyzing these data we may be able to understand the
  disparity in homeownership among groups from different backgrounds, assess the risk
  of default, or even detect bubble leading to events like the 2008 housing crash."
